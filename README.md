## Unlocking My Potential: A Journey in Java Programming  

Welcome to my InternPE Java Programming Internship Tasks repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I developed during my internship. These projects are designed to showcase my skills in Java programming and provide insights into various concepts such as game development, file handling, and object-oriented programming.

## Introduction  
During my internship, I focused on several Java programming projects, ranging from a number guessing game to file handling applications. Each project is stored in a separate folder with relevant documentation to explain the key concepts and techniques used.  

## Tasks  

### Task 1: Number Guessing Game  
*Description*: This project is a simple yet engaging game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game features multiple difficulty levels and a replay option.  

- *Technologies*: Java  
- *Skills Learned*: Loops, conditionals, user input handling  
- *Project File*: [GuessNumber.java](https://github.com/Balavignesh-25/INTERNPE/blob/main/GuessNumber.java)

### Task 2: Rock Paper Scissors Game  
*Description*: A more advanced version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game includes multiple rounds, dynamic feedback, streak tracking, and an option to play again. The user competes against the computer, and the scores are tracked throughout the game.  

- *Technologies*: Java  
- *Skills Learned*: Conditionals, loops, user input validation, random number generation, game logic  
- *Project File*: [RockPaperScissors.java](https://github.com/Balavignesh-25/INTERNPE/blob/main/RockPaperScissors.java)
