## Unlocking My Potential: A Journey in Java Programming  

Welcome to my InternPE Java Programming Internship Tasks repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I developed during my internship. These projects are designed to showcase my skills in Java programming and provide insights into various concepts such as game development, file handling, and object-oriented programming.

## Introduction  
During my internship, I focused on several Java programming projects, ranging from a number guessing game to file handling applications. Each project is stored in a separate folder with relevant documentation to explain the key concepts and techniques used.  

## Tasks  

### Task 1: Number Guessing Game  
*Description*: This project is a simple yet engaging game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game features multiple difficulty levels and a replay option.  

- *Technologies*: Java  
- *Skills Learned*: Loops, conditionals, user input handling  
- *Project File*: [GuessNumber.java](https://github.com/Balavignesh-25/INTERNPE/blob/main/GuessNumber.java)

### Task 2: Rock Paper Scissors Game  
*Description*: A more advanced version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The game includes multiple rounds, dynamic feedback, streak tracking, and an option to play again. The user competes against the computer, and the scores are tracked throughout the game.  

- *Technologies*: Java  
- *Skills Learned*: Conditionals, loops, user input validation, random number generation, game logic  
- *Project File*: [RockPaperScissors.java](https://github.com/Balavignesh-25/INTERNPE/blob/main/RockPaperScissors.java)

### Task 3: Tic Tac Toe Game  
*Description*: This project is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, allowing for single-player mode against an AI or two-player mode. It features real-time board updates, winner/draw detection, and a replay option.  

- *Technologies*: Java  
- *Skills Learned*: Arrays, conditionals, loops, game logic, AI development  
- *Project File*: [TicTacToe.java](https://github.com/Balavignesh-25/INTERNPE/blob/main/TicTacToe.java)

### Task 4: Connect Four Game  
*Description*: This is a Java implementation of the Connect Four game with a dark mode theme. Players can choose to play against an AI or another player. It includes game logic, AI implementation using the minimax algorithm, and win detection. The board is drawn using a graphical interface built with Swing.  

- *Technologies*: Java, Swing  
- *Skills Learned*: Arrays, graphics, game logic, AI development, event handling  
- *Project File*: [ConnectFourDarkMode.java](https://github.com/Balavignesh-25/INTERNPE/blob/main/ConnectFourDarkMode.java)
